### Database Design Process

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Understand requirements
    * Problem domain
    * Need
    * Context, Scope, Perspective
    * Use cases & roles
    * Security & Privacy
    * Use cases & Queries
2. Conceptual design
    * Entities, Attributes, Relationships
    * Entity-Relationship Diagrams
3. Logical design
    * Convert entties, attributes, & relationships to tables
    * Normalization & functional analysis
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
4. Physical design
    * Fully defined tables
    * Integrity constraints & triggers
    * Reporting; adding views
    * Maintenance; adding procedures
    * Consider access; define API
5. Implementation
    * Code it
    * Run & test
    * Debug
    * Repeat
:::
::::

Normalization
: Reorganization of columns and tables of relational database to minimize data redundancy and inconsistencies

Entity Relationship Diagrams
: Maps meaning and interactions of real-world entities to a conceptual schema

### Entity Relationship Components
Entities
: Represent real-world objects, concepts, or things, represented with rectangle

* **Strong** Entities exist independently
* **Weak** Entities depend on a strong entity.
* If Strong Entity is deleted, all Weak Entities are deleted

Attributes
: Properties and characteristics that describe entities

* **Simple Attributes** cannot be divided any further, whereas **Composites** can
* "Full Name" can be divided into "First Name" and "Last Name"
* **Multi-Valued attributes** can have multiple values for a single individual
* **Derived Attributes** are values that can be calculated from other attributes
* **Key Attributes** help uniquely identify entities.

Relationships
: Illustrates how entites are related to each other

* **Recursive Relationships** are entities that relate with itself
* **Associative Entity** hold extra data about the relationship, usually N:M
* **N-Ary Relationships** involve more than two entities, commonly ternary relationships

### Chen Notation
```{dot}
graph  ER{
    layout = neato;
    scale = 4.0
    node[shape = box, width = 0.5]; building; room
    node[shape = ellipse]; address, occupant, room_num
    node[shape = diamond]; has

    building -- has [label = "1", len = "0.25"]
    has -- room [label = "n", len = "0.25"]

    building -- address [len = "0.25"]
    room -- occupant, room_num [len = "0.25"]
}
```

### Crow's Foot Notation
```{mermaid}

building ||-- |{ room : has

building{
    string address
}
room{
    string occupant
    string number
}
```
:::
::::

### Cardinality
number of instances of one entity associated with number of instances of another entity through a relationship

One-to-One (1:1)
: each instance of one entity is related to only one instance of another entity

One-to-Many (1:N)
: each instance of one entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity, but instance of the other entity is related to only one of the first entity

Many-to-Many (N:M)
: each instance of one entity can be related to many instances of another, and vice versa

### Participation
indicates whether an instance of an entity is required to have a corresponding related instance in the related entity

Total Participation
: every instance of the participating entity must be related to at least one instance of the related entity.

Partial Participation
: instance of the participating entity may or may not be related to an instance of the related entity.

### Supertype and Subtypes
Entities can either be generalized or specialized to improve data integrity and minimize redundancies

* "Vehicle" can be a supertype for the subtypes "Car" and "Motorcycle"
* Employee can be supertype for the subtypes "Engineer" and "Manager"

### Database Ecosystem
* Users and user needs
* Ways to connect
* Query Processor
* Storage Manager
* Physical Storage

### Designing a database
* Develop better understanding of the database itself
* Helps smoothly translate conceptual and logical design into the physical design
* Choice of database may constrain or shape the final design
:::
:::

### Users and User Needs
:::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-6}
End User
: uses API to access database

Application Programmer
: Devlops API

Business Analyst
: Uses query tools to directly access database
:::
:::{.g-col-6}
Database Administrator
: Designs logical and physical schemas
: Handles security and authorization
: Oversees data availability, crash recovery, software updates
: Monitors performance and tunes database as needs evolve
: Manages users and access control
:::
:::

:::{.grid}

### Storage Manager
program that provides interface between low-level data in database, programs, and queries submitted to a system

**Responsible for**

* Interaction wtih file manager
* efficient storing, retrieving, and updating data

**Considerations**

* Types of storage access
* Types of file organization
* Types of indexing and hashing
* Types of authorization and access control
* Data integrity
:::
:::{.g-col-6}
### Query Manager
* Request Query (input)
    * query parser
    * relational algebraic evaluation
    * optimizer
    * planner (detailed code)
    * evaluator
* Response Query (output)

### Transaction Example
Transaction
: collection of operations that perform a logical function in a database application

Transaction-Manager
: ensures database consistency despite system and transaction failures

Concurrency-Control Manager
: controls interaction among concurrent transactions to ensure database consistency

### ACID Properties
Atomicity
: All operations of transaction are properly refleted in database, or none are

Consistency
: Execution of a transaction in isolation preserves the consistency of the database

Isolation
: Each transaction must be independent of other concurrently executing transactions

Durability
: After a successful transaction, changes made to database persists, even after system failures.

### Data Defined Language (DDL)
* DDL compiler generates a set of tables stored in a data dictionary
* Data dictionary contains metadata on:
    * tables, fields, data types
    * primary & foreign keys
    * data integrity constants
    * referential integrity
    * authorization rules
:::
::: {.g-col-6}
### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
provides statements for non-data related activities in database

* managing users
* tuning storage
* backing up database
* physical storage management on system
* communication with other systems
:::

### Relational Model - Entities
::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
* Tables represent entities
* Fields are columns in tables that represent attributes
* Records (tuples) are rows in tables that are instances of data
* Keys are relationships between tables

Schema
: Complete definition: entities, attributes, relations, data types, & constraints

SQL (Structured Query Language)
: Most widely used query declarative language for accessing relational databases
:::
::: {.g-col-6}
```
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    year INT
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    credit_hours INT
);

CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

### Relational Model - Attributes
::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
Attributes
: Represented as fields or columns

Domain
: set of allowed values for each field

Null
: member of every domain. DB designer must specify to include NULL or NOT NULL

Attributes have specific data types. DDL specifies the data types:

* String
* Numeric
* Date
* Object

:::
:::{.g-col-6}
Relation Notation
: represents tables or entities

* relationName (ID, Attr1, ..., AttrN)
* student (id, title, credit_hours)
* course (id, title, credit_hours)

Modifiers for individual attributes can be added

* student (id [PK], title, credit_hours)
* course (id [PK], title, credit_hours)
:::
:::

### Relational Model - Key
Key
: Any field in a table used to uniquely identify each tuple with any data type

Records can have multiple keys

* **Super key** is a key of one or more fields
* **Candidate key** is a key of minimal size
* **Primary key** is selected from one of the candidate keys to be the the unique identifier of a tuple
* Every relation must have a primary key

### Relational Model - Relationships
Relationships between tables and rows are modeled by connecting individual records using their keys

Foreign Key
: column in table containing copies of keys from another table referencing related rows. Must contain valid references or must be NULL

An attribute can be both a primary and foreign key referencing a column of a nother table

Foreign Keys do not have to have the same name as the referenced key

Cardinality and participation represented through foreign keys and integrity contraints

### Relational Model - Integrity Constraints
Integrity constraint
* condition that must be true for every instance in the relation
* specified in definition of the database schema
* verified by DBMS at every CRUD operation (Create, read, update, delete)

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-6}
**Domain Integrity**

* ensures that fields contain correct data
* by data type
* by length or size
* by negative values
* by set of allowed values
* by NULL or NOT NULL
* by UNIQUE or not

:::
::: {.g-col-6}
**Referential Integrity**

* maintains cardinality and participation
* primary keys must be unique
* foreign keys must exist

:::
:::

### Relational Algebra

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-4}
**Relational Operators**

* σ - Selection
    - outputs rows of the relation
* π - Projection
    - outputs columns of relation
* ρ - Rename
    - renames table

:::
::: {.g-col-4}
**Set Operators**

* ∪ - Union
* ∩ - Intersection
* -- - Difference


**Logical Operators**

* ∧ - AND
* ∨ - OR
* ¬ - NOT

:::
::: {.g-col-4}
**Joins and Products**

* ⋈ - Natural Join
* ⋈~θ~ - Theta Join
* ⟕ - Left Outer Join
* ⟖ - Right Outer Join
* ⟗ - Full Outer Join
* ⨯ - Cartesian Product
* ÷ - Division

:::

### Extra Notes

* Tuple = Row
* Degree = Number of Columns
* Cardinality = Number of Rows
